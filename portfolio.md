Introduction to using Python to create a model, in this case to simulate sending letters during the Republic of Letters. It was an excellent introduction to another instance of Digital Humanities that we didn't have time to discuss in class. Especially interesting to actual create a visual representation of the model. 


## Lesson 2: Introduction to Stylometry with Python

Used stylometry to determine the authorship of some disputed documents from the Federalist Papers. I was excited to try out stylometry after a fellow student discussed their stylometry project in class. It was also interesting because I've heard about similar projects to determine the authorship of Shakespeare, so it was nice to see exactly *how* this process can actually work. 


## Lesson 3: Analyzing Multilingual French and Russian Text using NLTK, spaCy, and Stanza

Did part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization for French and Russian in Tolstoy's War and Peace. Since most of what I will be working on is in Latin and/or Greek, I figured it would be worthwhile to understand how this sort of textual analysis works for languages other than English.
