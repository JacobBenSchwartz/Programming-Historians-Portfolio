    "# Mapping the Signal Beacons from Aeschylus' Agamemnon\n",
    "In Book 2 of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Phaethon drives his father Phoebus' (Apollo's) sun-chariot, but his inability to control it wreaks havoc and destruction on far-flung places of the Earth. In this lesson, we will use Natural Language Processing and Named Entity Recognition to find the locations destroyed within this story, then use Pleiades and ArcGIS to map the locations to get a sense for how broad an area of the world Ovid imagined to have been imperiled by Phaethon's actions.
