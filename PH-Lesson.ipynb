    "# Mapping the Signal Beacons from Aeschylus' Agamemnon\n",
    "In Aeschylus' \"Agamemnon,\" Clytaemnestra describes the sequence of beacons which sent the signal of Troy's defeat from Troy all the way to Argos. In this lesson, we will use Natural Language Processing and Named Entity Recognition to find the locations within this text, then use Pleiades and ArcGIS to map the locations and trace the path which the signals are said to have taken to evaluate whether or not it makes sense.
