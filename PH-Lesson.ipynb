    "# Mapping the Locations of Phaethon's Burning from Ovid's Metamorphoses\n",
    "In Book 2 of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Phaethon drives his father Phoebus' (Apollo's) sun-chariot, but his inability to control it wreaks havoc and destruction on far-flung places of the Earth. In this lesson, we will use Natural Language Processing and Named Entity Recognition to find the locations destroyed within this story, then use Pleiades and ArcGIS to map the locations to get a sense for how broad an area of the world Ovid imagined to have been imperiled by Phaethon's actions.

    "Looking at the distribution of locations, we can see most of them clustered around the Aegean Sea, in mainland Greece and Asia Minor. This is perhaps unsurprising, reflecting the Hellenic origins of Ovid's source material and his adherance to those ancient sources. Also unsurprising is the second densest cluster of locations being in Italy, Ovid's home and the location of much of his audience. We see him include places like the Tiber, the Apennines, the Po, and the Alps, all locations which are unlikely to appear in classical Greek versions of the myth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have the more far-flung locations. Some of these, like Caucasus and the Ganges in India, represent the furthest known boundaries of the world from a Greek perspective, appearing in the Argonautica and the history of Alexander, respectively. Others, like the Rhine and the Rhone, are far more familiar to a Roman audience as places on the frontier of the empire. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we see here, then, is a mostly Helleno-centric model of the world, where known places are clustered around Greece and become more few and far between the further away from Greece we travel. However, it is also a model which is slightly skewed towards Western Europe and places known to the Romans, reflecting their unique geographical perspective. "
